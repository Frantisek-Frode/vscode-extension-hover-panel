# suggestbox README

suggestbox (name pending) is an extension for vscode.
It aims to remove all the annoying popups such as hover information, suggestions, etc., without hiding them completely.
This is achieved by putting the information into sidebars/panel.

Similar functionality is provided by the [Docs View](https://github.com/mattbierner/vscode-docs-view) extension, which unfortunately shows just hover information.

## Features
The extension is at the moment in very early developement.

### Currenly supported
* shows hover information in panel/sidebar
* shows call signature information in panel/sidebar

### Not yet implemented
* move suggestion functionality to panel/sidebar
* show problems as a part of hover information

## Setup
Since the extension is far from finished, it is *not* available at the extension marketplace.
To launch vscode with this extension in debugging mode, clone this repo, open it in vscode and launch it by F5.
There might also be a way to install extensions from non-official sources; see google.
